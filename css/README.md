# tufte css

You can use the [original tufte.css](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/) for
a proper effect. Be sure to grab all the custom fonts. If you do this, you
may be inclined to modify `index.css` for colors & fonts.

Otherwise, you can just move these two files into you project and enjoy.

### modifications

What I've changed:

* background color from yellow to neutral
* removed custom fonts
* switched to relative sizing
