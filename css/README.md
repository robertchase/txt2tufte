# tufte css

Use the [original tufte.css](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/) for
a proper effect. Be sure to grab all the custom fonts.

The two `css` files included here add support for an `index.html` and
navigation from the article files. Note that they are *additive*
to `tufte.css`&mdash;include them `after` including `tufte.css`.
